# CiitibikeDataAnalysis
Data Mining through Visuilization, Hypothesis Testing. Also Predicitve Analytics/Machine Learning through Classification Tree. Using libraries ggplot2, rpart, rpart.plot


In this R file, I am using the Citibike Dataset to uncover valuable insights through the use of data visualization, proving the visualization with hypothesis testing, and creating a classification tree to predict average trip duration.
